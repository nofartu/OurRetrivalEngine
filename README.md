# OurRetrivalEngine
This project has been developed as part of a Information Retrieval course, which took place during the fall semester of 2018 in Ben Gurion University. 
This project can be divided into two parts: 
- Part 1: text pre-processing:

  - Reading all documents from corpus
  - Parsing documents into terms and tokens
  - Stemming all the tokens
  - Create inverted index, a dictionary and posting files
  
 - Part 2: after having all the data saved and organized
    - Search for queries
  
    - Rank and display them according to the relevancy


## before you start
In order to start running the notebook you must first download the corpus, stop words and create a place to save all information.
only the first part of the GUI is relevent to the preprocessing.
After creating the dictionary you can run queries and recive the most relevnt documents.

*note: the creation of the dictionary can take a long time due to the size of the corpus.
